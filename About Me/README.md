# Motivation for this document
This document is my user guide.  It should serve to help you understand me better and help us work better together. The faster we know get to know each other and how we like to work, the faster we'll be able to dig deep into the topics that matter most.

Below, you will find my core values, how I like to work, and some of my nuances.

Please reach out at any time with questions.  As a manager, I feel like the team is my first responsibility and my work is second.

This document is not meant to excuse any failings that I have, nor is it meant to tell you how you must act.  It is simply a guide for you to get to know me better.

# Outside the Office
When I'm not working you can find me doing any of the following:
- Spending time with family and friends.  I have a wife and a son who is currently 2.5 years old.
- Outdoors activities: hiking, biking, camping, etc. 
- Playing guitar and writing music.
- Bouldering and yoga, although I'm a beginner at both of these.
- Interviewing others and producing podcast episodes.  Ask me about my podcast and I'll happily share it!
- Building software.  I've built countless systems from the ground up. Feel free to ask me about any of them.
- Reading fiction and business/management books (eg. Sword of Truth Series, Mistborn, Hitchhiker's Guide, Stolen Focus, High Output Management).
- Eating.  I love to share great food with great company! (Din Tai Fung, Sup, Mastro's are a few favorites)
- Traveling. I gain so much perspective by seeing new places, experiencing new things, and meeting new people.
- Doing something uncomfortable.  The more uncomfortable I am, the more I am growing.

# My role
The value I provide to our organization is measured across 4 dimensions:
1. Ensuring that we formulate ambitious, realistic plans.
2. Continously improving our ability to execute to meet those plans.
3. Empowering the team to innovate so that we deliver value to the customer faster and more reliably.
4. Motivating, inspiring, and ensuring the retention of our most valuable resource - our people.

## How can I help you?
I help create high performing teams by:
- Steering our annual landmark targets and breaking them down into realistic quarterly roadmaps and OKRs.
- Running quarterly goal setting and reviews for all team members to set expectations and provide formal feedback.
- Facilitating quarterly team building events to celebrate our team and our progress.
- Opportunistically training and holding tech talks with the team to help us continuously improve.
- Being hands-on when it matters to help solve difficult issues or support the team where they need it most.
- Holding regular 1:1s with team members to discuss whatever's most relevant to you: career aspirations, sharing and receiving feedback, discussing strategies and opportunities, or anything else that's top of mind for you.
- Providing context, being curious, and focusing on value, to enable us to make the best decisions we can.

# What do I value most?
Values are a queue in that we make decisions based on their order of importance. They are the compass which helps me make navigate and make better decisions.

## My values:
1. <b>Family / Work-Life Harmony</b>. I'm super passionate and love what I do, but at the end of the day I'm much more than my work.  So finding the right harmony between life and work is essential to preventing burnout.
2. <b>Authenticity: Bring Your Whole Self to Work</b>. Being able to have authentic dialog with others takes vulnerability.  If you can't be honest with yourself and bring your whole self to work, you can't be authentic with others or be vulnerable.
3. <b>Empathy + Curiosity</b>. Active listening is essential to helping others live happier, more fulfilling lives. Also, deeply understanding others helps me share the best opportunities with them, and where they have the highest potential impact. Lastly, knowing the right questions to ask is so essential to solving problems, understanding a customer's real needs, and so much more in our day-to-day work. 
4. <b>Transparency and Trust</b>. It's really easy to become demotivated when you don't have enough information to do your job effectively.  The best teams are the most empowered ones because they have all the information they need to do their job effectively. Trust is a dimension of transparency formed through two-way communication.  If we can't trust each other, then we can never have constructive conflict or hold each other accountable.
5. <b>Opportunity + Ownership = Accountability</b>. You can't have accountability without ownership.  And you can't have ownership without the opportunity to take it. You should take ownership of opportunities as soon as they present themselves.  I should be on the lookout for potential opportunities that could be a fit for you and share them with you.  The better we know each other, the better I know what kinds of opportunities you're interested in and the more I can be on the lookout for them.
6. <b>Asynchronous Communication = Returned Time</b>.  Meetings can suck the life out of the most energized people, especially 8+ hours a day, back-to-back.  But meetings can be essential when done right.  I always opt to communicate through writing first and only meet when absolutely necessary.  I expect the same from others.  This helps the writer to articulate their thoughts better, the reader to better understand the topic, and both parties to ask deeper questions, potentially saving countless hours of meetings.  Always try to solve things through asynchronous communication first and meet only when absolutely necessary, with the minimum number of people required for the meeting.

## My Assumptions
1. <b>You're very good at your job</b>. You wouldn't be here if you weren't.  If it feels like I'm questioning you it's because I'm trying to build context or I'm being a sounding board or devil's advocate.
2. <b>You'll let me know if you can't do your job</b>. It's my job to make sure you have the skills and resources needed to be successful and to give you growth opportunities that are challenging yet fun.  If you feel overextended at any point, please come to me and we can find a solution together.
3. <b>You feel safe debating with me</b>. The more scrutiny an idea holds up to, the better the idea tends to be.  You may often find me playing devil's advocate not because I disagree, but because I want to make sure we're making the best collective decisions we can.  You should feel just as empowered to debate with me to ensure my decisions are the best for our context.

## How can you help me?
1. <b>Always be honest</b>.  It doesn't serve either of us to lie.  Even when it hurts to share something, it's often better to get it on the table and work through it together.
2. <b>Be better today than you were yesterday, everyday.</b>.  I'm motivated by surrounding myself with the best people and you're one of them!  The best people have a growth mindset and continuously learn and grow.
3. <b>Challenge me to be a better engineer and manager</b>.  One of the best people for me to learn from is you.  You have a perspective that is unique and all your own.  You see challenges from a different lens than I do.  The more we share with each other, the more complete our understanding becomes, and the greater the chance we do the right thing is.
4. <b>Disagree with me</b>. Whether you agree with my idea or not, sometimes the best thing you can do is disagree to be a devil's advocate.  This helps us ensure that the best ideas win, regardless of where they come from.
5. <b>Tell me when I make mistakes</b>. We are all human and mistakes are inevitable. Listening to feedback helps me adapt, overcome, and grow.  Please tell me when I do something wrong so that I may learn from you and become a better manager.

# My Expectations

## Scheduling Time with Me
My number one priority is my team, so I have an open door policy.  You should feel empowered to come to me with any request, at any time, for any reason.

Please try to communicate with me first over Slack before opting to schedule a meeting.  I've found that there's very little that can't be accomplished asynchronously.  Meetings generally should be a last resort and should have a document that sets the context, explains the purpose, and articulates what we hope to accomplish during our time together.

## My Availability
During the workday I do my best to be responsive to emails, slacks, meeting requests, and phone calls, but during the course of a day sometimes certain things have to take a back seat.  Typically my priority is first the meeting I'm currently in, second slack threads/messages that I'm directly involved in, and then email, text, or phone calls.

After hours the best way to get in touch with me is texting my personal phone number.

My general SLA for these modes of communication are:

### During work:
| Tool                           | SLA        |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Slack - War Room (w/ @Mention) | 30 minutes |
| Slack - Direct Message         | 2 hours    |
| Slack - @Mention               | 2 hours    |
| Slack - Channel Discussion     | 1 day      |
| Email                          | 1 day      |
| Text                           | 1 day      |
| Phone Call                     | <24 hours  |

### After work:
| Tool       | SLA     |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Slack      | N/A     |
| Email      | N/A     |
| Text       | 2 hours |
| Phone Call | 2 hours |

* Note: please keep in mind the above SLAs are my target.  If I'm on vacation or we're in the midst of a customer escalation I may not meet these. But I will do my best to keep to them.  Please do call me out when I miss these!

## Your Development
Your career is yours to own.  You know best the areas you'd like to grow in and where you'd like my help.  I can help provide an outside perspective and identify some opportunities, but it is up to you to decide what's best for you.

The better I understand your career aspirations, unique ability, and passions, the better I can share potential growth opportunities.  After sharing them though, it's up to you to grab them by the horns and take them head on.

I expect you to set your goals and priorities on a quarterly basis and then review them with me.  I'm happy to coach and make recommendations where necessary, but I expect you to be the driver and take ownership.  I also expect you to reflect on your goals at the end of each quarter to share your personal performance evaluation with me and your personal take on development opportunities for the next quarter.

# 1:1s
Ideally 1:1s happen every week, but in our current context the best I'm able to do for FTEs is one hour every two weeks.  If there's a reason where you feel like you really need to meet more or less often, let's discuss it and decide what works best for us.

The goal of 1:1s are to discuss the most important topics on your mind.  It's not meant as a status meeting unless you feel strongly that you want to talk about status.

I'd appreciate if you prepare topics before our 1:1s so that we get the most out of our time.  

For help determining what topics you may want to discuss, feel free to check out these articles about 1:1's, why they're important, and how you can best leverage them to help you:

<b>Please do not wait until a 1:1 to discuss an urgent/important topic</b>. If you have something urgent to talk about reach out to me right now and I'll clear my calendar for us.

# Feedback
I thrive on feedback, no matter if it's positive or negative.  Learning how to continously improve is essential for me to serve you better.  So please don't ever hesitate to share feedback with me.

Three dimensions are required for people to continue to give you feedback:
1. <b>Safety</b>: you should not be punished for giving feedback; should be high
2. <b>Effort</b>: The amount of work in order to give feedback, also known as "how receptive are you to constructive feedback?"; should be low
3. <b>Benefit</b>: how likely is it that giving you feedback will materially impact your behavior? should be high

Let me know if I don't do well on any of these three dimensions. 
I'll let you know if you don't do well on any of these three dimensions.
